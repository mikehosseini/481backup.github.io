# What are AWS spot instances?

AWS spot instances are an amazing tool to significantly reduce your EC2 on demand instance costs by up to 90%. 
Spot instances are being used by an increasing number of businesses, ranging from SMBs to enterprises, for mission-critical and production workloads. 
Spot instance pricing has greatly reduced their cloud costs.

AWS spot instances are AWS's extra capacity. As a cloud provider, they must have extra capacity on hand in case of a surge in customer demand. To compensate for the loss of idle infrastructure, AWS offers this excess capacity at a massive discount in order to encourage usage. That is why spot instance pricing is so low in comparison to EC2 on-demand pricing.

## When should you use Amazon spot instances?

Amazon spot instances are commonly thought to be suitable for web servers, containerized software, and other stateless, fault-tolerant workloads.

In reality, however, they can be used for a much broader range of use cases with no significant impact on availability or performance. 
Following are some good examples:

1. Data and IP persistence are common requirements for **stateful applications**. Even if an AWS spot instance is replaced, with automated solutions, the workload will automatically restart in the desired Availability Zone, from the same exact data point, with root and data volumes, as well as private and public IPs, preserved.
2. **Machine Learning** is another area where profound learning and progress can be affected negative by unplanned interruptions of the AWS spot. However, with the right tools, you can successfully run all of your machine learning projects on spot instances.
3. **CI/CD operations** can be done on the ground very easily whether Jenkins, Chef, Gitlab or others.
4. Spot instances are ideal for **Big Data** running on AWS EMR, Hadoop, or Spark.
5. **Distributed DBs**, such as Elasticsearch, Cassandra, Mongo, that can handle a single instance "reboot" on the spot without data loss or affecting the service.
